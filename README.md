# customer_exit_prediction_model
Customers began to leave a Bank, every month. A little, but noticeable. Bank marketers have calculated that it is cheaper to retain current customers than to attract new ones.

The task is to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. I will be working with historical data on the behavior of customers and the termination of contracts with the bank.

I am going to build a model with an extremely large value of the F1-measure. What I want to do is bring the metric to 0.59 minimum.

Additionally, I will measure the AUC-ROC, and compare its value with the F1-measure.
